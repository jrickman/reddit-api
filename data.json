The hog is just another bomb bus after all, with the occasional youtube video of it going BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRT!, so in the grand scheme of things, this doesn't add to much. The real question is, how many hogs are left that can actually last 6 more years before they fall to pieces. It's an old airframe, and growing older.",

Most combat losses in Vietnam were from Russian built SAMs, they were deadly. An argument can be made for low altitude terrain masking, but in a war gone hot, that puts you at the mercy of far more radar guided guns than you&amp;#39;d care to count. The counter is the Mavrick, which gives you standoff range, but it&amp;#39;s razor thin margin, and during ODS, well we found just how thin that razor was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You should never plan for the current conflict, but the next one, and while Isis lacks sophistication now, will that last?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
